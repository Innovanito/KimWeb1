  <h2> WEB </h2>
  <p>
  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,<br>
   is an information system where documents and other web <br>
  resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators<br>
   (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be<br>
    interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over<br>
     the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are<br>
      transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
       (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software<br>
        application called a web browser, and are published <br>
        by a software application called a web server. The<br>
         World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,<br>
          which pre-dated the Web in some form by over tw<br>
          o decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.<br>
